- pre-commit: Runs linting on staged files.
- pre-push: Runs a build to ensure the code compiles.
- commit-msg: Ensures the commit message follows the conventional commits rules.

## Commits

This project uses [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to ensure that commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
